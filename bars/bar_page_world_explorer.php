	<h2>Deploy new world.</h2>
	<p>
		Deploying of a new world is very easy. First of all create image of 3 colors in
		your favourite image editor corresponding to the following rules:
		<ul>
			<li>
				green color (0x00ff00) - areas, which are walkable
			</li>
			<li>
				red color (0xff0000) - areas, which are not walkable
			</li>
			<li>
				blue dots (0x0000ff) - other robots or action points
			</li>
		</ul>
		In future I will add support for manipulation with other robots. But for now
		everything is very simple.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the image is ready go to the upploading area and submit your world with
		any name you like.
